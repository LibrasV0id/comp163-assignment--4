# My creative theme was to make a simple, basic RPG that resembled old RPGs while studying core classes.
# I used if/elif/else throughout my code; nested if statements are also throughout my code. I use logical operations for the semester outcome. I used identity to identify if you're a "student"
# hit play and just answer the questions as prompted.
# The ending is the subject you chose, along with your states and how you're currently doing in your semester.
